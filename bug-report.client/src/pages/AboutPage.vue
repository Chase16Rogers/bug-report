        <h4>I think this went pretty well. I'm mostly pleased with the way it looks and the attention to detail I was able to commit. There is, however, significant room for improvement that I don't particularly have the time or technical skills at this point to achieve. I'm sure this could look much nicer, but how I would go about it is beyond me. I'm sure most of my solutions could be much more elegant, but I was excited that they were even working. In summary, I'm proud of this piece, but it could be better.</h4>
